CasaOS for Raspberry PI is an image based on Raspberry PI OS lite. You will need a Raspberry PI 3 or 4,  a Micro SD card, and an internet connection to use it.

Flash the image to your SD card using the Raspberry PI Imager to get started. Once that's done, insert the SD card into your Raspberry PI and boot your Raspberry PI!
